### Overview
This project explores the application of quantum computing to enhance patch management strategies in cybersecurity. Traditional methods for prioritizing patches often focus on the severity of individual vulnerabilities, overlooking their interconnected nature and roles in complex attack chains. By modeling the problem as a Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC) problem and using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), we aim to identify the most critical vulnerabilities to patch based on their interconnectedness. This approach, implemented using the Classiq quantum computing framework, seeks to disrupt potential attack paths more effectively than traditional methods.

Further, the repository contains files to all codes and methods we have executed, as well as elaborate explanations on the mathemaical sub-topics the project utilises.

### Abstract
Patch management is essential for mitigating vulnerabilities in cybersecurity. Traditional methods often overlook the interconnected nature of vulnerabilities. This project uses quantum computing, specifically the QAOA applied to the MVC problem, to enhance patch prioritization strategies. The approach models vulnerability data as a bipartite graph and constructs a dual graph to capture interconnections. Results demonstrate the potential of quantum computing in transforming cybersecurity practices by providing a more holistic view of vulnerabilities【6:0†source】【6:1†source】.

### Introduction
Cybersecurity is critical in today's interconnected world, with networks constantly under threat from malicious actors exploiting software vulnerabilities. Patch management, the process of identifying and deploying security patches, is a crucial component of any cybersecurity strategy. Traditional approaches struggle with the volume and complexity of vulnerabilities. This project addresses this challenge by using the MVC problem and QAOA to identify critical vulnerabilities to patch, thereby maximizing resource effectiveness【6:0†source】【6:1†source】.

### Methodology
#### Network Systems as Graph
Network systems are represented as graphs, where nodes represent devices or software components, and edges represent the connections between them. Vulnerabilities and dependencies are modeled to understand attack paths and potential points of failure【1】【2】.

#### Minimum Vertex Cover Problem
The MVC problem involves finding the smallest set of vertices that cover all edges in a graph. This is analogous to identifying the critical vulnerabilities that need to be patched to secure the network【6:2†source】.

#### Understanding QAOA
QAOA is a quantum algorithm designed for combinatorial optimization problems. It uses a quantum circuit to approximate solutions to the MVC problem, aiming to find an optimal or near-optimal set of critical vulnerabilities to patch【2】.

### Implementation
#### Graph Construction and MVC Model
The project uses the Classiq framework to construct a bipartite graph representing vulnerability data and a dual graph to capture interconnections between vulnerabilities. The MVC model is then applied to this graph【3】.

#### Quantum Algorithm Integration
The QAOA is integrated with the MVC model, translating the problem into a quantum circuit. The circuit is designed to solve the MVC problem by iteratively optimizing the selection of critical vulnerabilities【3】.

#### Execution and Results
The quantum algorithm is executed, and the results are analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the patch prioritization strategy. Visualization tools are used to represent the identified critical vulnerabilities and their impact on the network's security【3】.

### Results
The results demonstrate that the quantum-inspired approach to patch management can effectively identify critical vulnerabilities, providing a more interconnected and holistic view of the network's security posture. This method shows promise in enhancing traditional patch management strategies【5】.

### Future Directions and Conclusion
Future work could extend this methodology to larger network systems and explore its application in IoT-enabled networks. While actual quantum computers are not yet commercially feasible, the project's approach highlights the transformative potential of quantum computing in addressing real-world optimization problems in cybersecurity.
