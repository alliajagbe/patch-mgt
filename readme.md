# Prioritizing Patch Management for Cybersecurity using Quantum-Inspired Vertex Cover Algorithm

The project is as undertook by Alli Ajagbe and myself (Ayush Sheth).

This is the README file for the project as well as the repo.

For checkpoint 1:

- We are addressing the literature review done already for the further creation and implementation of the project.
- The literature repo is the 'Quantum Computing Project Literature Reviews' file here.
- The Desc file linked here is descriptions and details, in brief, about the learnings and meanings of the requisite for the project. Going through them will providde ample background about Patch Management, Vertex Cover Algorithm, and how Quantum Computing makes up this project.
- The progress report doc to be submitted is also added as Report.docx
